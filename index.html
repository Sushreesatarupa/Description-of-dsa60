Use this course to revise your cpp fundamentals
<br><br>
And if anyone is using any other languages rather than c++ then don't worry.
Syntax may be different but concepts would remain the same!
<br><br>
Try finishing all topics of day 1 by Evening, then we shall solve 1-2 basic cpp questions.
<br><hr><br>
Use the wapp group to discuss among yourselves 
<br><br>
If you have any doubts or get stuck somewhere you can discuss here and also ask us for help.
