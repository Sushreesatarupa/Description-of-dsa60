Star the repo or fork it.
We shall start dsa from today.

https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/fork-cpp
Use this course to revise your cpp fundamentals

And if anyone is using any other languages rather than c++ then don't worry.
Syntax may be different but concepts would remain the same!

Try finishing all topics of day 1 by Evening, then we shall solve 1-2 basic cpp questions.

Use this group to discuss among yourselves 

If you have any doubts or get stuck somewhere you can discuss here and also ask us for help.
